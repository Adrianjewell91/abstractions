Look at the .js files. 

I think these break ups are appropriate for introductory learners.

Basically the problem is that if I'm capable of developing a skeleton like these,then it's easier for me to just code it rather than outsource it. 
 
Because I already did all the major thinking and testing writing for it, coding it will be easy,
but perhaps not for a massive software project where it's too much for one person.
